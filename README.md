If you want to help us develop this project, you must fork the repo first, then clone it to your local machine. 

Once you clone the repo down to your local machine, in the terminal run 'vagrant up' to init the VM. 

After that, create a branch based on the issues, we use [Git Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/) and feature branch everything.
