        <h3 class="sub-header">Who Should Register?</h3>
        <p>Transparent Trade Coffee works with direct trade roasters that are genuinely committed to transparency in their

            dealings with coffee growers. Currently, only single-origin coffees sold through

            direct trade or near direct trade channels can be featured on the Transparent

            Trade Coffee website.</p>
        <h3 class="sub-header">Why Register?</h3>
        <p>Transparent Trade Coffee provides a simple communication vehicle so that

            consumers can – at the time of purchase – know how much of their coffee

            dollars are going back to growers. Registered coffees are listed on our TT

            Coffees page help consumers make an informed decision. When they are

            satisfied with the economic treatment of the coffee grower, they click on the

            listing to go to the roaster's on-line store to learn more and make their coffee

            purchase.</p>
        <h3 class="sub-header">How to Register?</h3>
        <p><b>Complete the online registration form </b> which requires you to input the coffee

            name, the (on-line) retail price (including currency and bag size), a comment on the

            coffee (optional and limited to 140 characters), the coffee grower's (i.e., farm or

            cooperative) name and location (country), the web page address (where coffee is

            listed for sales) and the green price per pound (f.o.b.) paid to the grower.

            Each registration also requires you to upload

            your logo along with documentation of the green price paid per pound (terms of

            sale).</p>
        <p><b>Confirm the listing after our processing and validation processes are complete.</b> After registered

            coffees are submitted, we validate (but do not audit) the green price as stated

            in the documented terms of sale, confirming that it is comparable with our

            other green prices (i.e., f.o.b. price per green pound paid to the grower). We

            then calculate the return to origin percentage that goes to the grower. Before your

            registered coffee(s) go live on the website, you receive an email asking you to

            confirm the listing. Once confirmed, your coffees will be posted to the TT

            Coffees page and announced on our social media platforms (Facebook and

            Twitter).
