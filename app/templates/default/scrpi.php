        <p class="light-font-smaller">In the third quarter of 2016, the SCRPI fell by 6.3%.
            The average price for roasted specialty coffee at the end of September 2016 was $22.46 per pound.
            This breaks down into an average of $16.30 per pound for the lowest-priced coffees (-0.6%),
            and $28.62 for the highest-priced coffees (-9.2%) sold on the websites of the SCRPI roasters.**</p>
        <p class="light-font-smaller">The year-over-year increase in specialty coffee prices – from the third quarter of
            2015 to the third quarter of 2016 – was 3.4%. This breaks down into a 1.4% increase for the lowest-priced
            coffees, and a 4.6% increase for the highest-priced coffees.</p>
        <p class="light-font-smaller">The corresponding ICO Composite Price for green coffee rose to $1.39 per pound in
            September 2016. Thus, as retail prices for specialty coffees fell by 6.3%, commodity prices rose by 5.0%
            during the third quarter of 2016. Year over year, as average retail prices for specialty coffees rose by 3.4%,
            the ICO Composite Price increased by 20.0%.</p>
        <p class="light-font-smaller"><span id="star">*</span><em>In the third quarter of 2014, the number of SCRPI roasters
            fell from 60 to 59, as Green Mountain Coffee was acquired by Keurig. In the first quarter of 2015,
            the number fell to 58 because the Supreme Bean website went inactive. In the last quarter of 2015, Stone Cup
            Roasting was not selling roasted coffee on-line, reducing the number of active SCRPI
            roasters to 57.</em></p>
        <p class="light-font-smaller"><span id="star">**</span><em>The June 2016 SCRPI was influenced by the introduction

        <!-- <h3>Supplementary Analysis – Naming Coffee Growers</h3> -->
        <!-- <p class="light-font-smaller">While collecting 2015, Q2 SCRPI price data, we documented whether the name of the producing farm, farmer or cooperative was specifically mentioned on the web page that marketed each coffee. For example, when Blue Bottle Coffee sold its Brazil FAF Santa Clara Red Catuai Natural coffee, customers were told that “in the highlands of Divinolandia, Brazil, Milton Nogueira, the esteemed producer of Santa Clara estate, cares for his red Catuai coffee variety trees with a lot of pride.”</p> -->
        <!-- <p class="light-font-smaller">How prevalent is this practice of naming coffee growers? More than 60% (36 out of 58) of the highest-priced coffee listings in the 2015, Q2 SCRPI mentioned coffee growers by name. This percentage was just 12% (7 out of 58) for the lowest-priced coffee listings. The difference is explained in part by the fact that 44 out of the 58 lowest-priced coffees are blends and espressos, compared to only nine of the 58 highest-priced coffees.</p> -->
        <!-- <p class="light-font-smaller">This suggests that a non-trivial number of coffee growers are being recognized for the work that they do, and that this practice is more common among the more highly-valued coffees.</p> -->
        <!-- <p class="light-font-smaller">Does the specialty coffee market value knowing the identity of the coffee grower? The following chart suggest that it does, but only at the high end of the market. Among the lowest-priced coffees in the 2015, Q2 SCRPI, the seven that made specific reference to the grower sold for an average of $16.25 per pound, a $0.11 (0.7%) premium over the other lowest-priced coffees. Among the highest-priced coffees, the 36 that specifically named the grower sold for an average of $29.99 per pound; $5.98 (24.9%) more than the average charged for the other highest-priced coffees.</p> -->

        <p class="light-font-smaller">These observations confirm that there is a tangible interest within the specialty coffee market in knowing where coffees are coming from and who is growing the beans. Moreover, this willingness to name and charge premiums for specific coffee growers intensifies as we move from the lower to the higher end of the specialty coffee market.</p>
